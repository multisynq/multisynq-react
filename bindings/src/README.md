# Multisynq React Bindings

The `@multisynq/react` package provides a simple framework for using Multisynq together with React. The main principle of `@multisynq/react` is that React components fully assume the role of the View side of Multisynq. (Behind the scenes, a normal Multisynq View is still created to act as a slim contact point between the Multisynq Model and the React components, but all View side logic is implemented in the React components.)

Please also refer to multisynq.io/docs for more information.
